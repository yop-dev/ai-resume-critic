- [pdf-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse) - PDF text extraction for resume uploads
- [jsPDF](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf) - PDF generation for cover letter downloads
- [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/) - Modern icon set for the user interface
- [openai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) - API client for connecting to Groq's LLaMA-3-8B model
