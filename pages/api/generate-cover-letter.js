Create a compelling cover letter in a ${styleVariations[variation]} style based on the candidate's resume and the job description provided.

First, analyze the resume to extract:
1. The candidate's name, contact information, and current role
2. Key skills and qualifications that match the job requirements
3. Relevant work experiences and achievements
4. Educational background and certifications
5. Any unique selling points or standout accomplishments

Then, analyze the job description to identify:
1. The specific role title and company name (if available)
2. Key requirements and qualifications sought
3. Company values or culture indicators
4. Specific technologies, tools, or methodologies mentioned

IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Start directly with the cover letter content - DO NOT include any introductory text like "Here is a cover letter..."
- DO NOT include any explanatory text at the end like "This cover letter is tailored..."
- Use proper paragraph spacing with blank lines between paragraphs
- Format the letter professionally with proper sections
- End with an appropriate signature line (like "Sincerely," followed by the candidate's name)
- Ensure proper spacing throughout the document

The cover letter should:
1. Be professionally formatted with proper sections (greeting, introduction, body paragraphs, conclusion, signature)
2. Use the candidate's actual name and contact details from the resume
3. Directly reference 3-5 specific skills/experiences from the resume that align with key job requirements
4. Include at least one quantifiable achievement from the resume that demonstrates value
5. Show enthusiasm for the specific role and company
6. Be concise (around 300-400 words)
7. Include a call to action in the closing paragraph
8. Use professional but engaging language
9. Address specific requirements mentioned in the job description

Resume:
${resumeText}

Job Description:
${jobDescription}

Remember: Provide ONLY the cover letter content with no explanatory text before or after.`;
